## Now building:
* Building/Operating Now: A software to decrease entropy
* Twitter: @siyunhe2
* Current Interests: Building data intensive applications and meaningful
dataflow && safely & securely share AI data while preserving privacy. 

# Some great Challenges I'd love to help to solve
*  [14 Grand Challenges](http://www.engineeringchallenges.org/cms/challenges.aspx) for Engineering in the 21st Century identified by National Academy of Engineering, which to some extent represent the "biggest pains" that we are facing in the 21st centuryã€‚

## Some ideas I'm looking to see built or build myself:
* Software to decrease asymmetric information
* Knowledge engine 
* Effetive algorithm driven interests match service
* A one-to-one simulated platform of as mirror of realworld
* Cost effective distributed nuclear plants
* More eletrification of transportaion, as electric jets
* Cloud Robotics platfrom
* Cost effective brain computre interface(Good job Neurolink!)
* Auto CRISPR machine or application for synthetic biology [Nebula genomics]
