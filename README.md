## Now building:
* Building/Operating Now: A software to decrease entropy
* Twitter: @siyunhe2
* Current Interests: Building data intensive applications to empower recruting and meaningful
dataflow.

## Some ideas I'm looking to see built or build myself:
* Software to decrease asymmetric information
* Knowledge engine 
* Effetive algorithm driven interests match service
* A one-to-one simulated platform of as mirror of realworld
* Cost effective distributed nuclear plants
* More eletrification of transportaion, as electric jets
* Cloud Robotics platfrom
* Cost effective brain computre interface(Good job Neurolink!)
* Auto CRISPR machine or application for synthetic biology [Nebula genomics]
